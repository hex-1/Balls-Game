<h2> Other Details </h2>

This game was made by Laura Morris (myself) using the unity game engine. This was done entirely for entertainment only and does not come with any form of warranty. The game does not keep any logs of what happens and does not send any information to me or any other third parties.

I would recommend testing the game before your meeting either on a personal call or in a leaders meeting so you know what to expect and how well the game will work for you there is no minimum number of players you can have so you can test it on your own.
